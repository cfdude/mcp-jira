              text: `# Resource Not Found

Could not add team \`${toolArgs.teamId}\` to plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\`. This could be due to:

## Possible Causes
- **Invalid Plan ID**: The plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\` may not exist or may have been deleted
- **Invalid Team ID**: The team \`${toolArgs.teamId}\` may not exist or may not be accessible
- **Plans Feature Not Available**: Plans are a Jira Premium feature and may not be enabled
- **Instance Type**: Plans may not be available in your Jira instance type

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Verify Plan ID**: Use \`list-plans\` to see all available plans and their IDs
2. **Check Plan Existence**: Use \`get-plan\` to verify the plan exists
3. **Verify Team ID**: Ensure the team ID is correct and the team exists in your organization
4. **Check Team Access**: Verify you have access to the team you're trying to add
5. **Contact Administrator**: If both resources should exist, contact your Jira administrator

## Finding Team IDs
Team IDs can be found through:
- Atlassian Admin interface (for organization teams)
- Team management APIs
- Your Jira administrator
- Existing plan team listings using \`get-plan-teams\` on other plans

## Alternative Actions
- Use \`list-plans\` to see all available plans
- Create a new plan if the target plan doesn't exist
- Create a plan-only team if the team doesn't exist organizationally`,
            },

              type: 'text',
              text: `# Access Denied

You don't have permission to add team \`${toolArgs.teamId}\` to plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\`. This could be due to:

## Permission Issues
- **Feature Not Enabled**: Plans are a Jira Premium feature and may not be enabled
- **Insufficient Plan Permissions**: You may not have edit permissions for this plan
- **Team Access Restrictions**: You may not have permission to assign this team
- **Global Permissions**: You may lack the "Administer Jira" global permission

## Resolution Steps
1. **Contact Plan Owner**: Ask the plan owner to add the team
2. **Request Permissions**: Ask your Jira administrator for plan edit permissions
3. **Check Team Access**: Verify you have access to manage the team
4. **Feature Verification**: Confirm Plans feature is enabled for your instance

## Alternative Approaches
- Ask a plan administrator to add the team for you
- Use project-level team assignment instead of plan-level
- Create plan-only teams that you can manage within the plan scope

Contact your Jira administrator if you need access to manage plan teams.`,

The request to add team \`${toolArgs.teamId}\` to plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\` could not be processed. This could be due to:

## Common Issues
- **Team Already Assigned**: The team may already be assigned to this plan
- **Invalid Team ID Format**: The team ID format may be incorrect
- **Plan Capacity Limits**: The plan may have reached its team limit
- **Team Type Restrictions**: The team type may not be compatible with this plan

## Error Details
${error.response?.data?.errorMessages?.join(', ') || error.message}

## Troubleshooting
1. **Check Current Teams**: Use \`get-plan-teams\` to see currently assigned teams
2. **Verify Team ID**: Ensure the team ID is in the correct format
3. **Plan Limits**: Check if there are limits on team assignments
4. **Team Compatibility**: Verify the team type is compatible with plan requirements

## Team ID Formats
Different team types may have different ID formats:
- **Atlassian Teams**: Usually UUID format (e.g., \`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\`)
- **Plan-Only Teams**: May use different ID schemes
- **Legacy Teams**: Could have numeric or string IDs`,

Team \`${toolArgs.teamId}\` is already assigned to plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\`.

## Current Status
The team you're trying to add is already part of this plan. No action is needed.

## Next Steps
- Use \`get-plan-teams\` to view all currently assigned teams
- Use \`get-plan\` to see the plan overview including team information
- If you need to modify team settings, use \`update-plan\` with appropriate JSON patch operations

## If You Expected This to Work
This might happen if:
- The team was previously added by another user
- The operation was already completed in a previous request
- There was a delay in the system updating team assignments`,
