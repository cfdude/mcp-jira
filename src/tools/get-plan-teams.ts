This plan currently has no teams assigned. Teams help organize work and provide:

- **Capacity Planning**: Understand team workload and availability
- **Resource Allocation**: Assign work to appropriate teams
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor team-specific progress
- **Collaboration**: Facilitate cross-team coordination

### Adding Teams
- Use \`add-plan-team\` to assign existing Atlassian teams
- Create plan-only teams for specialized groupings
- Consider team capacity when assigning work` : ""}

**Permission Distribution**:

## üí° Team Management Tips
- **Atlassian Teams**: Best for permanent, organization-wide teams
- **Plan-Only Teams**: Useful for temporary project groupings or cross-functional teams
- **Regular Review**: Periodically review team assignments as project needs evolve
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Ensure each team understands their role in the plan
- **Capacity Management**: Monitor team workload to prevent overallocation

## üîó Available Actions
- Use \`add-plan-team\` to assign additional teams to this plan
- Use \`remove-plan-team\` to remove teams from this plan
- Use \`get-plan\` to view overall plan details including team summary
- Use \`update-plan\` to modify team-related configurations

Could not retrieve teams for plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\`. This could be due to:

- **Invalid Plan ID**: The plan ID may not exist or may have been deleted
- **Plans Feature Not Available**: Plans are a Jira Premium feature and may not be enabled
- **Instance Type**: Plans may not be available in your Jira instance type

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Verify Plan ID**: Use \`list-plans\` to see all available plans and their IDs
2. **Check Plan Existence**: Use \`get-plan\` to verify the plan exists
3. **Contact Administrator**: If you believe this plan should exist, contact your Jira administrator

## Alternative Actions
- Use \`list-plans\` to see all available plans
- Use \`get-plan\` to view basic plan information including team count`,

You don't have permission to view teams for plan \`${toolArgs.planId}\`. This could be due to:

- **Feature Not Enabled**: Plans are a Jira Premium feature and may not be enabled
- **Insufficient Permissions**: You may not have the necessary permissions to view plan teams
- **Plan Permissions**: The plan may have specific view permissions that exclude you

## Alternative Planning Approaches
Consider using these alternatives for team planning:
- **Project Roles**: Use project roles to organize team members
- **User Groups**: Create user groups for team management
- **Components**: Use components to assign work to specific teams
- **Labels**: Use labels to categorize work by team
